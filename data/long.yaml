q: Nobody should start to undertake a large project.  You start with a small trivial project, and you should never expect it to get large.  If you do, you'll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage.  Or worse, you might be scared away by the sheer size of the work you envision.  So start small, and think about the details.  Don't think about some big picture and fancy design.  If it doesn't solve some fairly immediate need, it's almost certainly over-designed.  And don't expect people to jump in and help you.  That's not how these things work.  You need to get something half-way useful first, and then others will say "hey, that almost works for me", and they'll get involved in the project.

q: The most unfair thing about life is the way it ends.  I mean, life is tough.  It takes up a lot of your time.  What do you get at the end of it?  A Death!  What's that, a bonus?  I think the life cycle is all backwards.  You should die first, get it out of the way.  Then you live in an old age home.  You get kicked out when you're too young, you get a gold watch, you go to work.  You work forty years until you're young enough to enjoy your retirement.  You do drugs, alcohol, you party, you get ready for high school.  You go to grade school, you become a kid, you play, you have no responsibilities, you become a little baby, you go back into the womb, you spend your last nine months floating... and you finish off as an orgasm.

  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it," is the slogan of the complacent, the arrogant, or the scared.  It's an excuse for inaction.  It's a mindset that assumes (or hopes) that today's realities will continue tomorrow in a tidy, linear and predictable fashion.  Pure fantasy.  In this sort of culture, you won't find people who proactively take steps to solve problems as they emerge.

q: From a bit to a few hundred megabytes, from a microsecond to a half an hour of computing confronts us with completely baffling ratio of 10**9!  The programmer is in the unique position that his is the only discipline and profession in which such a gigantic ratio, which totally baffles our imagination, has to be bridged by a single technology.  He has to be able to think in terms of conceptual hierarchies that are much deeper than a single mind ever needed to face before.

q: Some complain that e-mail is impersonal -- that your contact with me, during the e-mail phase of our relationship, was mediated by wires and screens and cables.  Some would say that's not as good as conversing face-to-face.  And yet our seeing of things is always mediated by corneas, retinas, optic nerves, and some neural machinery that takes the information from the optic nerve and propagates it into our minds.  So, is looking at words on a screen so very much inferior?  I think not; at least then you are conscious of the distortions.  Whereas, when you see someone with your eyes, you forget about the distortions and imagine you are experiencing them purely and immediately.

  An ad that pretends to be art is -- at absolute best -- like somebody who smiles warmly at you only because he wants something from you.  This is dishonest, but what's sinister is the cumulative effect that such dishonesty has on us: since it offers a perfect facsimile or simulacrum of goodwill without goodwill's real spirit, it messes with our heads and eventually starts upping our defenses even in cases of genuine smiles and real art and true goodwill.  It makes us feel confused and lonely and impotent and angry and scared.  It causes despair.

q: The only way you can write the truth is to assume that what you set down will never be read.  Not by any other person, and not even by yourself at some later date.  Otherwise you begin excusing yourself.  You must see the writing as emerging like a long scroll of ink from the index finger of your right hand; you must see your left hand erasing it.

q: When government steps aside, it is not as if nothing takes its place.  Paradise does not prevail.  It's not as if private interests have no interests, as if private interests don't have ends they will then pursue.  To push the antigovernment button is not to teleport us to Eden.  When the interests of government are gone, other interests take their place.  Do we know what those interests are?  Are we so certain they are better?
